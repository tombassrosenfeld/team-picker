# tech_challenge_201804
End of course tech challenge set by DevelopMe_. Build a five-a-side team picker. 

# The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly picks 5-a-side football teams from a list of 10 names (10 players = 2 teams of 5).

It's up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
support for n-a-side, where a list of any length can be split into two teams
support for balancing of the teams, where some measure of each player's strength is used to allocate teams fairly

Some suggestions

The employers will be looking at your code, so I would strongly suggest you look to demonstrate clear thinking, good quality code and use of comments.

You should document what you have done and why, to demonstrate your planning process, and clear thinking.

If your tool requires a particular environment to run (e.g. Node or PHP) then this should be documented (as a readme.md?) with instructions provided (e.g. a Vagrantfile, package.json, gulpfile.js etc.). In short: I shouldn't struggle to get it working on my local machine, and you shouldn't assume I know how it is supposed to work.

You might want to show your experience and competence with Git by version managing your project from the start and providing a link to the repository on GitHub.
